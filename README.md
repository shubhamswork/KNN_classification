# KNN_classification
The code computes whether a user takes an action or not by watching a social advertisement given his salary and age.
It is based on K nearest neighbours where we can determine  how many neighbours have to be chosen.  Then an euclidian distance is calculated 
from  all the neighbours to the unknown member. Those neighbours who are counted as most nearest to the unknown member is considered the 
predicted class of the unknown member
